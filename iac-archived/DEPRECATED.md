# ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED - Day 1 Implementation (AVM Focus)

## Status: ARCHIVED

This directory contains the **Day 1 implementation** focusing on Azure Verified Module (AVM) patterns. This implementation has been **superseded by the unified solution** in the `deploy/` directory.

---

## Why Was This Archived?

The Day 1 implementation provided excellent security patterns but lacked orchestration capabilities. The **unified solution** (found in `deploy/`) combines:

- ‚úÖ **All Day 1 AVM security features** (managed identities, encryption, Trusted Launch)
- ‚úÖ **Plus Day 3 orchestration capabilities** (ServiceNow, pipelines, Day 2 operations)
- ‚úÖ **Plus new enterprise features** (monitoring, backup, governance automation)

---

## What Was in Day 1?

### Strengths
- ‚úÖ Azure Verified Module (AVM) patterns
- ‚úÖ Managed identity support (system + user-assigned)
- ‚úÖ Encryption at host enabled by default
- ‚úÖ Trusted Launch (Secure Boot + vTPM)
- ‚úÖ Customer-managed key encryption
- ‚úÖ Azure Monitor Agent with VM Insights
- ‚úÖ Data Collection Rules (DCR)

### Limitations
- ‚ùå No ServiceNow integration
- ‚ùå No automated orchestration
- ‚ùå Limited Day 2 operations support
- ‚ùå Manual governance deployment
- ‚ùå Manual backup configuration

---

## Migration to Unified Solution

### All Your Security Features Are Preserved!

The unified solution **includes ALL Day 1 AVM patterns**, enhanced with orchestration:

| Day 1 Feature | Unified Solution | Status |
|---------------|------------------|--------|
| Managed Identity | `deploy/terraform/terraform-units/modules/compute/` | ‚úÖ Enhanced |
| Encryption at Host | Enabled by default in compute module | ‚úÖ Preserved |
| Trusted Launch | Secure Boot + vTPM support | ‚úÖ Preserved |
| CMK Encryption | Disk Encryption Set integration | ‚úÖ Preserved |
| Azure Monitor Agent | `deploy/terraform/terraform-units/modules/monitoring/` | ‚úÖ Migrated |
| VM Insights | Dependency Agent + DCR | ‚úÖ Migrated |
| Boot Diagnostics | Enhanced with optional storage URI | ‚úÖ Enhanced |

### Migration Path

**Option 1: Keep Existing Resources, Add Orchestration**
1. Deploy unified solution to `deploy/` directory
2. Your existing VMs continue running unchanged
3. Use unified solution for new deployments
4. Gradually migrate existing workloads (optional)

**Option 2: Gradual Migration**
1. Test unified solution in dev environment
2. Validate security features match Day 1
3. Deploy to UAT for testing
4. Roll out to production gradually

**Option 3: Reference Architecture**
- Keep this directory as reference
- Use unified solution for all new work
- Copy security patterns as needed

- ‚úÖ Azure DevOps pipelines (5 pipelines)
- ‚úÖ Shell script automation (8 scripts)
- ‚úÖ Transform layer for input normalization

### Day 2 Operations (New in Unified)
- ‚úÖ Disk modification automation
- ‚úÖ VM SKU change automation
- ‚úÖ Backup and restore automation
- ‚úÖ Complete lifecycle management

### Enterprise Features (New in Unified)

## File Mapping

| Day 1 Location | Unified Location | Status |
|----------------|------------------|--------|
| `iac/terraform/modules/compute/` | `deploy/terraform/terraform-units/modules/compute/` | ‚úÖ Enhanced with SAP patterns |
| `iac/terraform/modules/monitoring/` | `deploy/terraform/terraform-units/modules/monitoring/` | ‚úÖ Migrated with enhancements |
| `iac/terraform/modules/network-*` | `deploy/terraform/terraform-units/modules/network/` | ‚úÖ Consolidated |
| Manual deployment | `deploy/scripts/deploy_*.sh` | ‚úÖ Automated |
| Manual governance | `deploy/scripts/deploy_governance.sh` | ‚úÖ Automated |

---

## Can I Still Use Day 1?

**Yes**, but it's not recommended because:

1. **Missing Orchestration**: Manual deployment vs automated pipelines
2. **No ServiceNow Integration**: Users must manually request VMs
3. **Limited Day 2 Operations**: Manual disk/SKU/backup operations
4. **No Telemetry**: No deployment tracking or auditing
5. **Manual Governance**: Policy deployment not automated

### When You Might Reference Day 1

- **Learning**: Understand AVM patterns
- **Comparison**: See how features evolved
- **Reference**: Copy specific security configurations
- **Migration**: Understand current implementation
