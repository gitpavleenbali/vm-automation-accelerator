---

## 🎯 Merge Strategy: 7-Phase Approach

### **Phase 1: Foundation - Adopt SAP Structure as Base** ✅
**Decision**: Keep `deploy/` directory structure as the architectural foundation.

**Rationale:**
- Superior architecture (bootstrap/run, transform layer)
- Zero compilation errors
- Better state management
- More maintainable and scalable

**Actions:**
- ✅ Retain `deploy/terraform/bootstrap/` (local state)
- ✅ Retain `deploy/terraform/run/` (remote state)
- ✅ Retain `deploy/terraform/terraform-units/modules/`
- ✅ Retain `deploy/scripts/` (deployment automation)
- ✅ Retain `boilerplate/` and `configs/`

---

### **Phase 2: Pipeline Integration** 🚀 **HIGH PRIORITY** - ✅ 70% COMPLETE
**Goal**: Integrate Azure DevOps pipelines with SAP deployment patterns.

**Current State:**
- ✅ `deploy/pipelines/azure-devops/` directory created
- ✅ 2 reusable templates completed (script-execution, terraform-validate)
- ✅ Control plane pipeline completed (316 lines)
- ✅ Workload zone pipeline completed (410 lines)
- ✅ Comprehensive pipeline documentation (520 lines)
- 🚧 VM deployment pipeline (in progress)
- 📋 VM operations pipeline (planned)
- 📋 Full deployment orchestration pipeline (planned)

**Actions Required:**

1. **Create New Pipeline Directory Structure**
   ```
   deploy/pipelines/
   ├── azure-devops/
   │   ├── control-plane-pipeline.yml         # Deploy foundation
   │   ├── workload-zone-pipeline.yml         # Deploy networking
   │   ├── vm-deployment-pipeline.yml         # Deploy VMs
   │   ├── full-deployment-pipeline.yml       # End-to-end deployment
   │   ├── vm-operations-pipeline.yml         # Disk/SKU/restore operations
   │   └── templates/                          # Reusable pipeline templates
   │       ├── terraform-init-template.yml
   │       ├── terraform-plan-template.yml
   │       ├── terraform-apply-template.yml
   │       └── script-execution-template.yml
   └── github-actions/                         # Future GitHub Actions support
   ```

2. **Adapt Existing Pipelines to SAP Pattern**
   - **Control Plane Pipeline**: Calls `deploy/scripts/deploy_control_plane.sh`
   - **Workload Zone Pipeline**: Calls `deploy/scripts/deploy_workload_zone.sh`
   - **VM Deployment Pipeline**: Calls `deploy/scripts/deploy_vm.sh`
   - **Operations Pipeline**: Integrate disk/SKU/restore operations

3. **Pipeline Features to Preserve from Day 1:**
   - ✅ Multi-environment support (dev, uat, prod)
   - ✅ Approval gates for production
   - ✅ Automated backend initialization
   - ✅ Plan/Apply/Destroy workflows
   - ✅ Parameter-driven execution
   - ✅ Variable groups per environment

4. **New Pipeline Capabilities (SAP Pattern):**
   - ✅ Bootstrap → Run migration workflow
